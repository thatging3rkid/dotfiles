# dotfiles

These are my config files for zsh, emacs, nano, and tmux.

## Installation

`install.sh` will run everything automatically, so it's the suggested install method. If you don't feel comfortable running a random shell file you found on the internet and you can't figure out what's going on in it, all you have to do is initialize the rust-mode submodule, then copy the dotfiles.
